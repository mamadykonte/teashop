            Black tea, or red tea in China, is one of the most popular tea
            flavors and is fully oxidized. The leaves of the Camellia sinensis
            plant are withered, rolled, oxidized / fermented, and dried or fired
            to produce a strong, full-bodied flavor. Assam, Darjeeling, Nilgiri,
            and Sri Lanka are a few well-known black tea producing regions, and
            the flavor will vary based on the region and type of black tea.
